Feature: CreateDirectory

  Scenario Outline: Validate that directory is created
    Given I created a directory <dirName> in my home directory
     When I write 5 files with 10 lines each in <dirName>
     Then I list all the files in <dirName>
     And I concatenate all files in <dirName> into a temp file

    Examples: 
      | dirName |
      | test1   |
      | test2   |
      | test3   |
