Feature: Login

  Scenario Outline: Positive Login test
    Given I opened the app using following <URL>
    When I type "student" into the Username field
    And I type "Password123" into the Password field
    And I click the Submit button
    Then the URL should contain "practicetestautomation.com/logged-in-successfully/"
    And the page should display "Congratulations" or "successfully logged in"
    And the Log out button should be visible

    Examples: 
      | URL                                                     |
      | https://practicetestautomation.com/practice-test-login/ |
